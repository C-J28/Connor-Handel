            <p class = "text">
                &emsp;Currently I am a student studying with Drexel university to complete a degree in computer and technology security.  I have always had a place in my heart for exploring the unknown. My siblings and I would spend hours in the woods making up fun and games with our surroundings. From the woods to my workbench it feels the same to be exploring the unlocked potential of personal computing. <br>
                &emsp;Over time I discovered more and more great tools to try and further my knowledge of computers and eventually microcontrollers. A long time ago, when Radio Shacks had roamed the Earth I had come upon a Raspberry pi Model A beginner kit. It was one of the coolest things I had ever seen, a computer the size of a credit card, how could you beat that. I quickly got to tinkering with it, so many times I had to unplug my moms workstation ethernet cable to try and install a program on the pi. <br>
                &emsp;As time went on I expanded my arsenal of boards to include classics such as the Arduino Uno, a few esp 8266 and 32 boards, some more Raspberry Piâ€™s (including the new pico boards), and, the ugly duckling, the Onion Omega2 board. So far my favorite single board computer has been the Raspberry Pi 3B, because it has great performance for the price. My favorite microcontroller is the esp 32, because it is so versatile and approachable for such a low price.  <br>
                &emsp;Another great piece of kit that I have delved into the past couple years is a 3D printer. Before purchasing it I had begun learning to 3D model so I would have a line up of files to test out whatever printer I would eventually decide on. I picked the Anycubic Chiron, not a great beginner printer, but it has been great for learning how to troubleshoot a printer. <br>
                &emsp;I hope to always have opportunities to further my knowledge and skills when it comes to the world of computers. <br>
